AI Rule: Keep docs/AI_Cheatsheet.md up-to-date

Purpose

- Ensure every change to the codebase or docs is reflected in `docs/AI_Cheatsheet.md` so AI agents and humans have a single source of truth for implementation status.

When to Update

- After completing any implementation task, refactor, or documentation change that affects features, phases, or decisions.
- At the end of a PR and before merging to `main`.

How to Update

1. Edit `docs/AI_Cheatsheet.md`:
   - Mark relevant items in Section 2 (Implementation Status) as “In Progress” or “Done”.
   - Update Phase status in Section 3, if applicable.
   - Adjust Section 4 “Open Decisions” if you resolved or added decisions.
   - Add PR/commit link(s) next to updated bullets.
2. If scope changed, update the matching phase doc under `docs/architecture/`.

Cursor Agent Guidance

- Before starting a task: read `docs/AI_Cheatsheet.md`, `docs/Project_Definition.md`, the relevant phase doc, and `docs/Design.md`.
- After finishing a task: update `docs/AI_Cheatsheet.md` immediately in the same turn.
- If you create new features or remove planned ones, reflect that in both the Cheatsheet and the appropriate phase file.

Definition of Done Extension

- A task is not “Done” until `docs/AI_Cheatsheet.md` accurately reflects the change.
